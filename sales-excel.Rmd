```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

-   Read in the Excel file called `sales.xlsx` from the `data-raw/` folder such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-1.png")
```

```{r}
sales <- read_excel("data-raw/sales.xlsx", skip = 3, col_names = c("id","n"))
```

-   **Stretch goal:** Manipulate the sales data such such that it looks like the following.

```{r}
sales %>%
mutate(is_brand_name = str_detect(id, "Brand"))
```


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-2.png")
```

```{r}

```
